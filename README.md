# simple-trello-app

It's a Trello clone with single board where user can:  
* create/update/delete list and give it a name
* create/update/delete a task inside the list and give it name and short description
* drag’n’drop tasks inside the list and between the lists

As a backend used localStorage to keep info about lists and tasks, so after refresh user should see the lists and tasks as they were before reload.
Technical requirements:
* angular(v7)
* ngx-bootstrap

* **@ngrx (advanced)
